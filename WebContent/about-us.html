												<h1>About Us</h1>
												<span>Why We</span>
										</div>
										<p>You will require less number of Staff to cater more patients in same time or even less. You would have the choice to re-deploy them at other suitable locations. We not only provide an opportunity to the hospital to enhance their patient care but also can increase the profitability of the organization.</p>
                                        <p>
We would enable hospitals or Nursing Homes to serve the rapidly growing number of health care consumers in a cost-effective manner. We can also save extra money on your current computer hardware shopping. Hospital administrators would be able to significantly improve the operational control and thus streamline operations. This would enable to improve the response time to the demands of patient care because it automates the process of collecting, collating and retrieving patient information</p>
<p>
This software interface would also save them a lot of time for special jobs. Accounting sometimes becomes awfully pathetic and complex. This product will eliminate any such complexity, since the retrieval of information through its MIS will become virtually on the tip of your fingers. Very important for some, the reduced cost of the manpower would pay for the cost of this product with in a short time after its implementation
